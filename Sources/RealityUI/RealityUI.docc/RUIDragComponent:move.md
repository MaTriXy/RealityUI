# ``RealityUI/RUIDragComponent/DragComponentType/move(_:)``

The `move` case of the ``RUIDragComponent/DragComponentType`` enum facilitates movement interactions in a 3D environment, with the option to apply constraints via ``RUIDragComponent/MoveConstraint``. This feature is crucial for applications requiring dynamic and controlled movement of entities in a 3D space.

### Purpose and Functionality

The `move` interaction type is designed for applications where user-driven repositioning of entities is essential. It allows entities to be moved either freely or along predefined constraints, offering a balance between interactivity and controlled behavior.

### Move Constraints

The `move` interaction can be paired with different types of ``RUIDragComponent/MoveConstraint`` to tailor the movement:

1. **Box Constraint**: Restricts movement within a specified `BoundingBox`, providing a defined area where the entity can move.

2. **Points Constraint**: Limits movement to a set of predefined points, represented as an array of `SIMD3<Float>`.

3. **Clamp Constraint**: Uses a custom clamping function to control the movement. This function takes a `SIMD3<Float>` as input and returns a modified `SIMD3<Float>` to determine the new position.

### Usage Examples

```swift
// Example: Moving an entity within a bounding box
let boxConstraint = MoveConstraint.box(BoundingBox(min: [-1, -1, -1], max: [1, 1, 1]))
let boxMoveComponent = RUIDragComponent(type: .move(boxConstraint))
entity.components.set(boxMoveComponent)

// Example: Moving an entity to specific points
let pointsConstraint = MoveConstraint.points([...])
let pointsMoveComponent = RUIDragComponent(type: .move(pointsConstraint))
entity.components.set(pointsMoveComponent)

// Example: Applying a custom clamp function to movement
let clampFunction: (SIMD3<Float>) -> SIMD3<Float> = { /* Custom clamping logic */ }
let clampConstraint = MoveConstraint.clamp(clampFunction)
let clampMoveComponent = RUIDragComponent(type: .move(clampConstraint))
entity.components.set(clampMoveComponent)
```

### Implementation Tips

1. Choose the appropriate ``RealityUI/RUIDragComponent/MoveConstraint`` based on the interaction needs of your application.
1. For precise movement control within a defined cuboid area, use the box constraint.
1. To restrict movement to a few specific locations, use the points constraint.
1. For more specific locations, use the clamping function, as it will be more efficient.
1. For complex or non-linear movement patterns, consider implementing a custom clamping function with the clamp constraint.
1. Ensure that the movement feels intuitive and responsive from the user's perspective.
