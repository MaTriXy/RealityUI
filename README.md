# RealityUI

RealityUI is a collection of utilities and UI objects for RealityKit.
The UI objects included in RealityUI aim to offer familiar User Interface standards, but in a 3D setting for Augmented and Virtual Reality through RealityKit.

RealityUI also has a collection of components for interfacing with any Entity through touch or drag interactions.

## Installation

### Swift Package Manager

Add the URL of this repository to your Xcode 11+ Project under `Project > Swift Packages`.

`https://github.com/maxxfrazer/RealityUI.git`

## Usage

Add `import RealityUI` to the top of your swift file to start.

#### Registering RealityUI Components

All components used in RealityUI must be registered before they are used, simply call `RealityUI.registerComponents()` anywhere in your app before any classes starting with `RUI` are initialised to avoid issues with that. For more information on what is meant by registering components [see Apple's documentation here](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/realitykit/component/3243766-registercomponent).

#### Activating Gestures

Enabling RealityUI gestures can be doen by calling `RealityUI.enableGestures(.all, on: ARView)`, with `ARView` being your instance of an [ARView](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/realitykit/arview) object.

RUISlider, RUISwitch, RUIStepper and RUIButton all use ``RUIDragComponent``, which requires `.ruiDrag`. If you are adding elements that use the component `RUITapComponent` you can use the gesture `.tap`.
I would just recommend using `.all` when enabling gestures, as these will inevitably move around as RealityUI develops.

`RealityUI.enableGestures(.all, on: arView)`

## Control Entities

By default all RealityUI Entities are quite large. This is used to standardize the sizes so that you always know what to expect. For example, all UI thumbs are spheres with a diameter of 1 meter, which is 1 unit in RealityKit, Â± any padding adjustments. All RealityUI Entities face `[0, 0, -1]` by default. To have them point at the user camera, or `.zero`, you can use the [`.look(at:,from:,relativeTo:)`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/realitykit/entity/3244094-look) method like so: `.look(at: .zero, from: [0, 0, 1])`. Or if you want it to turn around straight away if you've positioned it at `[0, 0, -1]`, set the orientation to `simd_quatf(angle: .pi, axis: [0, 1, 0])`. Using the [.look()](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/realitykit/entity/3244094-look) method works here by setting the `at:` value to the direction the button should be used from.

### RUISwitch

RUISwitch is a 3D toggle switch with an on and off state.
Default bounding box is 2x1x1m

![RUISwitches with and without light responsiveness](https://github.com/maxxfrazer/RealityUI/blob/main/media/switches_combined.gif?raw=true)

[More details](https://github.com/maxxfrazer/RealityUI/wiki/Control-Entities#ruiswitch)

### RUIStepper

RUIStepper is used to increment or decrement a value.
Default bounding box is 2x1x0.25m

![RUIStepper with light responsiveness](https://github.com/maxxfrazer/RealityUI/blob/main/media/stepper_light.gif?raw=true)

[More details](https://github.com/maxxfrazer/RealityUI/wiki/Control-Entities#ruistepper)

### RUISlider

An interactive track to represent an interpolated value.
Default bounding box is 10x1x1m including thumb.

![RUISlider with light responsiveness](https://github.com/maxxfrazer/RealityUI/blob/main/media/slider_light.gif?raw=true)

[More details](https://github.com/maxxfrazer/RealityUI/wiki/Control-Entities#ruislider)

### RUIButton

RUIButton is used to initiate a specified action. The action here will only trigger if the gesture begins on a button, and also ends on the same button. This is similar to the [touchUpInside UIControl Event](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uicontrol/event/1618236-touchupinside).
Default button bounding box before depressing the button into the base is `[1, 1, 0.3]`

## Gestures

All of the RealityUI Control Entities use custom gestures that aren't standard in RealityKit, but some of them have been isolated so anyone can use them to manipulate their own RealityKit scene.

### Drag

Drag objects anywhere in space with 3 degrees of freedom with [RUIDragComponent](https://maxxfrazer.github.io/RealityUI/documentation/realityui/RUIDragComponent), using the [.move](https://maxxfrazer.github.io/RealityUI/documentation/realityui/RUIDragComponent/move(_:)) type.

![Dragging Cubes](media/RUIDrag_cubes.gif)

This type has an optional constraint, to fix the movement within certain criteria:

1. **Box Constraint**: Restricts movement within a specified `BoundingBox`, providing a defined area where the entity can move.

2. **Points Constraint**: Limits movement to a set of predefined points, represented as an array of `SIMD3<Float>`.

3. **Clamp Constraint**: Uses a custom clamping function to control the movement. This function takes a `SIMD3<Float>` as input and returns a modified `SIMD3<Float>` to determine the new position.

### Turn

Unlock the ability to rotate a RealityKit entity with just one finger.

![Turning key](https://github.com/maxxfrazer/RealityUI/raw/e3cb908fa9051512671e01dd3fe01f59c45f0936/media/RealityUI_pivot_key.gif?raw=true)

[More details](https://maxxfrazer.github.io/RealityUI/documentation/realityui/RUIDragComponent/DragComponentType/turn(axis:))

### Tap

Create an object in your RealityKit scene with an action, and it will automatically be picked up whenever the user taps on it!

No Gif for this one, but check out [RUITapComponent](https://maxxfrazer.github.io/RealityUI/documentation/realityui/RUITapComponent) to see how to add this to an entity in your application.

If you instead wanted to use something similar to a "touch up inside" tap, you can use [RUIDragComponentType/click](https://maxxfrazer.github.io/RealityUI/documentation/realityui/RUIDragComponent/DragComponentType/click).

## Animations

There aren't many animations added by default to RealityKit, especially none that you can set to repeat. See the [wiki page](https://github.com/maxxfrazer/RealityUI/wiki/Animations) on how to use these animations.

### Spin
Spin an Entity around an axis easily using ruiSpin.

[More details](https://github.com/maxxfrazer/RealityUI/wiki/Animations#spin)

### Shake

Shake an entity to attract attention, or signal something was incorrect.

## Text

It's already possible to place text in RealityKit, but I felt it needed a little upgrade.

With RUIText you can easily create an Entity with the specified text placed with its bounding box centre at the middle of your entity.

![Hello Text](https://github.com/maxxfrazer/RealityUI/blob/main/media/RUIText_hello_example.gif?raw=true)
